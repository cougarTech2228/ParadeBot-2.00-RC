#include <Servo.h>
/* The 'Servo.h' library allows you to control motors and servos by passing any value between
0 and 180 into the "write" method (talon.write() in this program).
For a motor:   0 is full power in one direction,
             180 is full direction in the opposite direction,
              90 is stop.
For a servo:   0 is all the way one direction,
             180 is all the way in the opposite direction,
              90 is the middle.
